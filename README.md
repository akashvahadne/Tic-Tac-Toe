This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players who take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has won, the game results in a draw.
